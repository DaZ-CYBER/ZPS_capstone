# ZPS_capstone
Capstone project for the C# fundamentals course on ZeroPointSecurity.

This was a capstone project for the C# fundamentals course on ZeroPointSecurity. The goal of the project was to create a to-do list within a console that allows a user to add, delete, modify, and list entries within the to-do list. This supplemental project, in which the project assignment itself was created by RastaMouse, aimed to assist in learning C#.

The project below was created by myself, which allows the functionality of modifying the status of an entry, as well as the supplemental functions of adding and deleting an entry.
